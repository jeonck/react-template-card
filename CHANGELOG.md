# Digitaltwin-Hub to React-Template-Card Changelog

This document outlines the key changes made to transition the `digitaltwin-hub` project into the `react-template-card`.

## Project Renaming and Refocus

*   **Project Name:** The project has been renamed from `digitaltwin-hub` to `react-template-card`.
*   **Purpose:** This reflects a shift from a specific-purpose application to a general-purpose, reusable React template for future projects.

## Technology Stack and Architecture

*   **Build Tool:** The project now uses **Vite** for faster development and builds, as configured in `vite.config.ts`.
*   **Language:** The entire codebase is now written in **TypeScript**, providing static typing and improved code quality.
*   **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** is used for styling, configured via `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The application is structured around reusable React components located in the `src/components` directory.
*   **Routing:** A routing system is implemented, with pages organized in the `src/pages` directory, suggesting the use of a library like React Router.
*   **3D Graphics:** The `src/components/ThreeScene.tsx` component indicates the integration of 3D visualization capabilities, likely using **Three.js**.
*   **Localization:** The `src/utils/localization.ts` file suggests that the application is set up for internationalization and localization.

## Directory Structure and File Changes

*   **`src/pages`:** A hierarchical page structure has been established to organize different sections of the application.
*   **`public/data`:** Static data, such as `charts.json`, is now stored in the `public` directory.
*   **Configuration Files:** The project includes standard configuration files for TypeScript (`tsconfig.json`), Vite (`vite.config.ts`), and Tailwind CSS (`tailwind.config.js`).
